# IP Location Plotter

🌍 This project plots the geographical locations of IP addresses from a pcap file onto a KML map.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- dpkt
- pygeoip

## Installation

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ip-location-plotter.git
   cd ip-location-plotter
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install dpkt pygeoip
   ```
3. Download the GeoLiteCity database from [MaxMind](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/legacy/geolite/) and place it in the project directory as `GeoLiteCity.dat`.

## Usage
Run the program using the following command:
```
python ip_location_plotter.py >> location.kml
```

Note: Replace `'152.58.106.92'` with your own public IP address in the `src = gi.record_by_name('152.58.106.92')` line of the `ip_location_plotter.py` file.

## Viewing the Map
1. Go to [Google My Maps](https://www.google.com/mymaps).
2. Create a new map or open an existing one.
3. Click on "Add layer" to create a new layer.
4. Click on "Import" to upload the `location.kml` file generated by the script.
